# Airline Brands Comparison Dashboard ‚úàÔ∏è

A comprehensive Streamlit dashboard for exploring and comparing three different approaches to identifying lowest fare airline brands.

## Overview

This dashboard analyzes three datasets that represent different methodologies for identifying and categorizing airline fare brands:

1. **George Airline Level** (`george_airline_level.csv`): Aggregated fare family data by carrier
2. **George Source Level** (`george_airline_source_level.csv`): Detailed breakdown by carrier and booking source
3. **Teo Analysis** (`teo_airline_source.csv`): Advanced brand detection with comprehensive price analysis

## Features

### üìä Dashboard Sections

## Key Insights

The dashboard reveals several important patterns:

1. **Methodology Differences**: George's approach focuses on fare family categorization and volume, while Teo's approach emphasizes brand detection algorithms and price analysis.

2. **Coverage Variation**: Different datasets cover different airlines and sources, providing complementary views of the market.

3. **Brand Complexity**: Airlines use varying naming conventions for similar fare products, making standardization challenging.

4. **Source Impact**: The booking source significantly affects fare family availability and pricing.
